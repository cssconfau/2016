      <p>Let the fun starts before the conference even begins! Join your fellow CSSConf friends at the Melbourne Zoo for a <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/melbourne/whats-on/i-animal">night-time interactive tour</a>. You will explore the zoo in small groups while being guided by a mysterious device, hearing stories about the animals and learning secrets of the zoo at nightfall. It’ll be exciting, thought provoking and most importantly, an adventure that you won’t forget.</p>

      <p>After a day of inspiring talks it’s time to relax and unwind! We will have food and drinks all prepared, so you just need to come on down and have a good time with old and new friends. We will also be sharing the party with our friends from JSConf so if you’re attending JSConf as well, it’ll be a great way for you to meet the people there before the conference begins. <strong>Don’t forget your name badge</strong>.</p>
