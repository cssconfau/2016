Wow, what an amazing few days we had last week. 230 people, 166 tacos, 82 burgers, 70 bahn mi sambos, 8 kilos of bananas, 400 delicious coffees, 200 tees, and a whole lotta&nbsp;orange!

*Videos of the talks are [now available online](/news/videos/)*

To everyone who bought a ticket and came along on the day, thank you! Never did we think we'd get such a great turnout. It felt like a very special mix of creative coder types, and almost all from Australia or surrounding countries, many whom we'd never have met otherwise. This event was for you, and we hope you enjoyed every&nbsp;minute!

A big thank you to our speakers who put their love, sweat, tears and experience into sharing their inspiring work, stories and ideas: [Nicole](https://twitter.com/stubbornella), [Chris&nbsp;Wright](https://twitter.com/cwrightdesign), [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/necolas), [Connor](https://twitter.com/connors), [Ana](https://twitter.com/thebabydino), [Chris&nbsp;Giffard](https://twitter.com/cgiffard), [Lea](https://twitter.com/leaverou), [Simurai](https://twitter.com/simurai) and [Chris&nbsp;Eppstein](https://twitter.com/chriseppstein). We didn’t even ask what they were going to talk about because we knew they’d all be great. And they were! Thank you so much for your&nbsp;support.

Also a big thank you to the 50 other amazing people who submitted a talk proposal but ultimately weren’t selected. It takes time, energy and courage to submit a proposal, and it killed us to have to choose only a couple. A massive thank you to all of&nbsp;you!

To the friends and volunteers who put up their hand to help, and who, without clear direction or preparation, came together to make the day not only hitch-free but fun and carefree as well. Thank&nbsp;you!

To [Jared](https://twitter.com/rioter) and the [JSConf](http://au.jsconf.com/) crew: thank you for providing the perfect sister-event, helping with the logistics, supporting our crazy ideas and also helping on the day of&nbsp;CSSConf.

To the Decompress crew: [Mark&nbsp;Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) and [Paul&nbsp;Taggell](https://twitter.com/tagell). Paul contacted us to see if he and Melbourne Uni could help in any way. We then asked Mark if he could put his [MelbJS](http://melbjs.com/) know-how into creating, organising and running a side-event. A cross between a [Jelly](http://workatjelly.com/), a meetup, and an unconf. And what transpired was absolutely perfect. Thank you to you both, and those who helped on the&nbsp;day.

And most importantly, thank you to our sponsors. We were lucky enough to have amazing companies approach us and then wait patiently whilst we prepared our sponsorship packages. Thank you to our major sponsor [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/) who were responsible for the world-class coffee and beautifully hand-lettered coffee cups. Thank you to our second level sponsor [Envato](http://www.envato.com/), our third level sponsors [realestate.com.au](http://www.realestate.com.au/) and [Pin Payments](https://pin.net.au/), and finally [99designs](http://99designs.com.au/) and [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/). Without your support the event simply wouldn’t have&nbsp;happened.

And lastly, to the people that worked alongside us providing their skills and services: [Everyday&nbsp;Coffee](http://www.everyday-coffee.com/) for the amazing coffee and sweets; [Taco&nbsp;Truck](http://www.thetacotruck.com/), [Beatbox&nbsp;Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beatbox-Kitchen/108806049145877), [Banh&nbsp;Mi&nbsp;Boys](http://www.banhmiboys.com.au/) for the delicious food; Jim and the rest of [Arts&nbsp;House Melbourne](http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/artshouse/) for helping us transform the gorgeous heritage listed venue; [Carla&nbsp;Hackett](http://carlahackett.com/) for the lettering, illustration, signage, and tees; [SC&amp;F](http://www.scafplasticfabrication.com.au/) for the CSSConf stage sign; [Hilary&nbsp;Walker](http://hilarywalker.com.au/) for the photography; [PSI Screen&nbsp;Printing](http://www.psionline.com.au/) for the tees; and [Anthony&nbsp;Agius](https://twitter.com/decryption) for the filming, screen capture and&nbsp;editing.

We’re busily preparing the videos of all the talks, which should be up soon for everyone to see. But for now, we just wanted to say thank&nbsp;you.

From the entire CSSConf crew: thank you all for an amazing few days which we’ll never&nbsp;forget.
