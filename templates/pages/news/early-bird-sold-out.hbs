<p>Wow, what a few days since launch! We were hoping to catch up on some sleep after launching ticket sales, but it’s just been go-go-go.</p>

<p>Since last Wednesday we’ve had another few speakers lined up (announcement coming soon), 9 talk proposal submissions (we know the number, but can’t look at them yet), and the early bird tickets have all sold out.</p>

<p>If you didn’t get hold of an early bird ticket, never fear! Everyone who submits a talk proposal (by Friday 21 February) will be eligible for the early bird pricing, regardless of whether your proposal is accepted.</p>

{{#if cfpOpen}}

{{/if}}

<p>Now’s the time to talk about that cool thing you did a few months back, or perhaps nudge someone you know who would be great to have as a speaker.</p>

<p>And lastly a massive, massive thank you to everyone for your support! We’ve got some exciting things in the pipeline, and we’re thrilled that you’re as excited as we are.</p>
